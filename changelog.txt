* Improved matching performance by 1000x (9x algorithm, 8x multiprocessing, 15x caching)

v0.9
* Sequence to target matching now matches against all potential target sequences
* Inexact matching has been fixed
* The matching stage is now significantly slower than before

v0.16
* Initial plan was to allow custom workflows to be added to a mouse pipeline run
* Now is a complete reworking into an online "application"
* Replace multiple pipeline pages with a single "Dashboard" interface, with expanding/collapsing sections
* Never leave the main screen - everything is displayed
* Incorporates CSS and Javascript for the first time to allow dynamic browser features
* Refreshes screen on each change
* Select a "run" folder
* Compose an "inventory" of samples and plates
* Plan and track the whole "experiment"
* Keep a "run log" which allows complete re-running of an experiment
* There are no longer any "standard" primer plates - all primer plates are built for purpose, after the Nimbus stage concludes
* Requirements file added for dependencies

v0.15
* Initial attempt to support Musterer mice in custom manifests (running on the mouse pipeline)
* Incomplete due to changes planned for version 0.16
* New error handling/reporting code throughout

v0.14
* Replaced primercheck.py with validate_assays.py - Only checks against the assay list 
  (not primer plate), and generates list of required primers
* Additional protection aganst unguarded Nimbus output barcodes (creates guarded Echo_COC files)
* Creates guarded copy of custom manifest if it isn't already guarded
* Much improved analysis interface
* Caches moved to run folder

v0.13
* New analysis (stage 3) interface for running ngsmatch.py and gt_mice.py
* barcode protection for Musterer mnnnm, Rodentity MnnnM, custom cnnnc, plate pnnnp
* Separate out file interfaces to improve code maintainability
* Eliminate excess white-space/empty rows in files as an issue?

v0.12
* Separated Tm1a,b,c,d into their own cases for genotyping - genotyping *works*
* Removed --fast option from ngsmatch.py
* i7i5 barcodes now applied in rotating fashion (like primer pairs) in echo.py
* Sanity checking incorporated

v0.11
* Much improved genotyping code
* Hard coded Stage3.bat to run custom pipeline matching
* ngsmatch can now work with custom assay inputs

v0.10
* Added per-mouse genotyping report (much more human readable)
* Replaced genotyping algorithm to simplify and clean up process - needs another reboot sadly
* Bug fixes in lab pipeline to remove white spaces from names and empty rows from CSV files
* Improved matching performance by 1000x (9x algorithm, 8x multiprocessing, 15x caching)

v0.9
* Sequence to target matching now matches against all potential target sequences
* Inexact matching has been fixed
* The matching stage is now significantly slower than before
* Sequences with low coverage are reported as "other"
* Per-well "calling" has been removed as unnecessary
* Absence of single outcome assays (e.g. CRE) now results in a NEG genotype rather than a failure to report 

v0.8
* Extensive UI improvements to clearly delineate mouse runs from custom runs
* Run folders are generated and/or require mouse_ or custom_ to be prefixed - this will help keep the main project clean after being in use a long time
* Multiple taq/water plates are now used if one is insufficient
* Plate dead volumes have been increased to 50 and 700 nl for 384 and 6 well plates respectively
* Numerous code changes to improve modularity
